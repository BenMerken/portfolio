    "text": "With 3.5 years of experience as a full-stack web developer and consultant, I have developed extensive expertise in both front-end and back-end development, as well as advising clients on technical solutions.\nAfter these years in consultancy, I am now looking for a new challenge in in-house product development, where I can apply my technical knowledge to work on long-term projects and further optimize the quality of a product. Additionally, I am motivated to continue developing myself and am open to taking up additional training in network management to broaden my skills and take on a wider range of technical responsibilities."
